# Who's it for? # {#whos_it_for}
%Fungus is popular with writers, illustrators, animators and game designers, especially visual novel & interactive fiction authors. Many people using %Fungus are creating games in Unity for the very first time. It is a popular choice for game jams and game design courses.

# Free & Open Source # {#open_source}

We believe that interactive storytelling should be accessible to everyone, so %Fungus is <b>100% free & open source</b>. It works great with both the free and pro versions of Unity 3D. %Fungus is inspired by other great open source storytelling tools like [Twine], [Ren'Py] and [Scratch].

# Community # {#community}

The %Fungus community is very welcoming and helpful to newcomers. Many people using %Fungus have never used Unity or even made a game before, so feel free to ask questions on our [community forum]. Helping other people with their questions is a fantastic and very welcome way to contribute back to the community.
