# Course Description # {#description}

We've teamed up with Paul Mc Grath to create an extensive [training course] which teaches how to make storytelling games using %Fungus and Unity. Sales of this course help us to continue developing %Fungus, so it's a nice way to learn %Fungus and to support the work we're doing on the project.
